This codes were made to presente the results to a monograph and paper written by me and my advisor. We presented it in the last months of 2020. In the future i'd like to translate this codes in python, wich i've learned in 2021 after finished this paper (coming soon).

This work was designed as a research for conclusion work course in Bsc Economics. Also, i'd like to thank Renato Seixas who advised me.

Disclaimer: All the informations about the results and the references are on the text archives, and the database used (and prepared in data wrangling) is available in the repository I know this codes could be more organized and better writen, but i will work on a second version in python and a english text version.
