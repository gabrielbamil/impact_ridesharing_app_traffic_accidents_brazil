# impact_ridesharing_app_traffic_accidents_brazil
This codes were made to presente the results to a monograph and paper written by me and my advisor. We presented it in the last months of 2020. In the future i'd like to translate this codes in python, wich i've learned in 2021 after finished this paper (coming soon).

This work was designed as a research for conclusion work course in Bsc Economics. Also, i'd like to thank Renato Seixas who advised me.

Disclaimer: All the informations about the results and the references are on the text archives, and the database used (and prepared in data wrangling) is available in the repository I know this codes could be more organized and better writen, but i will work on a second version in python and a english text version.

Abstract:
This monograph aims to estimate the impact of the introduction of individual transport applications on traffic accidents. In order to find a causal effect, the gradual introduction of the offer of Uber services in 154 Brazilian municipalities with more than 250,000 inhabitants in the period from 2009 to 2017 was explored. Using a differences in differences strategy, no evidence of a statistically significant effect was found on death rates, number and value of hospitalizations related to traffic accidents per 100 thousand inhabitants. The result finds parallels in studies carried out in the USA that find the same pattern of behavior.

Keywords: Traffic accidents, Uber, Urban Diseconomies.
